##Codebook

This codebook is a summary of all the variables and their meanings (with units), to understand tidy.txt.

###Identifier fields:

 [1] "subject"                         
 [2] "activity"                        
 [3] "activity_num"                    

###Measurements (all are mean measurements for a give subject-activity(and activity_num) pair):
